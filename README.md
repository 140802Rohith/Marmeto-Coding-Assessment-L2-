The project  is an HTML document that represents a product page for a linen blue shirt. Let's break down the components and functionality of this project:

### 1. HTML Structure (`index.html`)

- **Document Type Declaration (`<!DOCTYPE html>`):** Defines the document type and version of HTML being used.
- **`<html>` Element (`<html lang="en">`):** Root element of the HTML document, specifying the language as English.
- **`<head>` Section:**
  - **Meta Tags:** Sets the character encoding (`UTF-8`) and viewport for responsive design.
  - **Title (`<title>`):** Sets the title of the webpage displayed in the browser tab.
  - **Font Import (`<link>`):** Imports the Inter font family from Google Fonts.
  - **External JavaScript Link (`<script>`):** Links an external JavaScript file (`script.js`) for dynamic functionality.

- **`<body>` Element:**
  - **Container (`<div class="container">`):** Contains the entire content of the webpage, setting a maximum width and centering it horizontally.
  
  - **Product Image Section (`<div class="product-image">`):** Displays the main product image with associated thumbnails that can be clicked to change the main image.
    - **`<img>` Element (`<img id="mainImage" src="..." alt="Product Image">`):** Displays the main product image with a border and a cursor pointer for interactivity.
    - **Thumbnails (`<div class="thumbnails">`):** Displays smaller thumbnail images that, when clicked, change the main product image.
  
  - **Product Information Section (`<div class="product-info">`):** Contains details about the product, such as title, price, color selection, size options, quantity selector, and add to cart button.
    - **Product Title (`<div id="productTitle">`):** Displays the title of the product (e.g., "Linen Blue Shirt").
    - **Product Price (`<p id="productPrice">`):** Displays the product price with a discount indication.
    - **Color Selection (`<div class="selectors">`):** Allows the user to choose a color for the product using clickable color options.
    - **Size Selection (`<input type="radio">`):** Provides radio button options for selecting the size of the product.
    - **Quantity Selector (`<input type="number">`):** Allows the user to specify the quantity of the product they wish to purchase.
    - **Add to Cart Button (`<button onclick="addToCart()">`):** Triggers a JavaScript function (`addToCart()`) when clicked, adding the selected product to the cart and displaying a confirmation message.
    - **Product Description (`<p id="productDescription">`):** Provides a description of the product.

### 2. CSS Styles (`<style>` Section)

The `<style>` section within the `<head>` of the HTML document contains CSS rules that define the appearance and layout of the webpage elements. Key styles include:

- **Font Family (`font-family`):** Sets the default font to Inter.
- **Layout (`display`, `flex`, `max-width`, `margin`, `padding`):** Uses flexbox to create a responsive layout with centered content and appropriate spacing.
- **Image Styling (`max-width`, `height`, `border`, `cursor`):** Defines styles for product images and thumbnails.
- **Color Selector (`border-radius`, `cursor`):** Styles circular color options for color selection.
- **Media Queries (`@media`):** Adjusts layout and styles for different screen sizes (e.g., tablets and mobile devices) to ensure responsiveness.

### 3. JavaScript Functionality (`script.js`)

The JavaScript file (`script.js`) contains functions that provide dynamic behavior to the webpage:

- **`changeImage(imageUrl)`:** Updates the main product image (`<img id="mainImage">`) with a new image URL when a thumbnail is clicked.
- **`selectColor(color)`:** Handles the selection of a color option by adding/removing CSS classes to indicate the selected color.
- **`updateQuantity(value)`:** Updates the quantity of the product based on +1 or -1 button clicks.
- **`addToCart()`:** Retrieves selected product details (title, price, color, size, quantity) and displays a confirmation message in an alert dialog.

### Summary

This project is a basic HTML webpage that simulates an e-commerce product page for a shirt. It uses HTML for structure and content, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactive functionality such as image switching, color selection, quantity updating, and adding items to a virtual shopping cart. The use of external JavaScript (`script.js`) helps keep the code organized and maintainable. The CSS styles ensure a visually appealing and responsive design across different devices and screen sizes.
